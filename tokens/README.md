# TI-Tokens

Library for interfacing with the [token sheets provided by TI-Toolkit](https://github.com/TI-Toolkit/tokens). Can parse
`8xp`s with `deku`, tokenize files, trace token versions, etc.

Extremely pre-alpha software; features have been added to this crate only as they have been needed for other projects
and unit tests are lacking or absent.
